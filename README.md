# leaflet demo

In this demo, leaflet was used in constructing a map with overlays that illustrate tectonic plates and seismic activities, i.e. loations and magnitude of earthquakes at different locations based on longitude and latitude.

* The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake via size and color (see legend)
* Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are shown as larger circles that are darker in color.
   
To run the app, please enter your API key in the config.js file before running python -m http.server/.
 
Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master/GeoJSON

Sample screenshots of the app are also provided in the repo.
