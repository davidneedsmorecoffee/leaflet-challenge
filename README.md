# leaflet demo

In this demo, leaflet was used to generate a map with overlays that illustrate tectonic plates and seismic activities.
The different overlays can be turned on and off by the user.

To run the app, please enter your API key in the config.js file before running python -m http.server/.
 
Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master/GeoJSON

Sample screenshots of the app are also provided in the repo.
